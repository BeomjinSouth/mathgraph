# Implementation Tracking

## Status

- Task: PDF-driven geometry and graph coverage improvement
- State: Done
- Last updated: 2026-05-19

## Plan

1. Read project operating docs, local OpenAI context, and relevant PDF/browser skills.
2. Sample the three local teacher-guide PDFs for representative diagram needs.
3. Update planning docs before runtime/schema changes.
4. Add first-class polygon runtime and AI schema parity.
5. Reconnect deterministic fallback for no-key/failed-API shape generation.
6. Run unit tests, render browser screenshots, update docs, commit, and push.

## Decisions

- Decision: Prioritize first-class polygon support.
- Reason: The sampled PDF pages repeatedly use triangles, quadrilaterals, similarity figures, graph regions, and histogram-like bars; a filled/selectable polygon closes the widest runtime and AI parity gap.
- Decision: Keep direct Responses API calls and strict Structured Outputs unchanged.
- Reason: This pass extends the graph operation contract but does not need new OpenAI orchestration or server-side behavior.
- Decision: Keep large teacher-guide PDFs out of Git.
- Reason: Each source PDF exceeds normal GitHub file-size limits and is local analysis input rather than app source.
- Decision: Validate the browser path with local structured JSON instead of a live external API call.
- Reason: No user API key was available in this environment; the same validated `operations[]` contract is used after OpenAI Responses output parsing.

## Blockers

- Blocker: None.
- Risk: Browser-local API keys remain a public-deployment security concern.
- Next action: Add Vercel serverless proxy/BYOK split in a follow-up if this becomes a shared production service.

## Verification

- Checks run:
  - `npm.cmd test`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `node --check js\objects\Polygon.js; node --check js\ai\AIService.js; node --check js\main.js; node --check js\tools\PolygonTool.js`
  - Headless Chrome/Playwright-core screenshot validation against `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`
- Result:
  - Passed. Unit tests reported 27 passing tests.
  - Browser validation produced `tmp/browser-captures/02-ai-polygon-coverage-scene.png` with 18 valid objects and no console errors.
  - Chat JSON validation produced `tmp/browser-captures/03-chat-json-polygon.png` with 1 valid polygon and no console errors.

## Handoff

- What changed:
  - Added first-class polygon runtime, tool creation, AI schema validation, AI patch application, SVG export, fallback examples, docs, and tests.
- What remains:
  - Follow-up chart/solid coverage still needed for histogram/frequency polygon/box plots and cylinder/cone/sphere style solids.
- Official sources checked:
  - `https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs`
  - `https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/methods/create`
  - `https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-computer-use`
