# Skills and Context

## Relevant Skills

- Skill: OpenAI Vibe Coding Context
- Why it matters:
  - This task changes OpenAI Responses API request construction, so local reference maps and current official docs must be checked before implementation.
- Local context read:
  - `docs/openai-context-map.md`
  - `docs/openai-core-summaries.md`
  - `docs/openai-docs-map.yaml`
  - `docs/vibecoding-openai-guide.md`
  - `docs/progress-log.md`
- Official docs checked:
  - `https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models`
  - `https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs`
  - `https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/methods/create`

## Current Task Notes

- Use Responses API Structured Outputs (`text.format.type = "json_schema"`) rather than older JSON mode.
- Keep model IDs configurable; current reference default for complex reasoning/coding is `gpt-5.5`.
- Strict schemas require required fields; use nullable fields and strip `null` values before local validation/application.
- Set `store: false` for graph-generation requests unless a future product decision needs stored responses.
- Direct browser API key storage remains a personal/BYOK compromise, not ideal for public deployment.

## Previous Relevant Skills

- Skill: None required beyond core repo work
- Why it matters:
  - This batch stays within the existing vanilla JS app architecture and does not require a specialized external workflow.

## Repo Notes

- Project-specific conventions:
  - Update task docs before and after feature work.
  - Keep Vercel linkage intact.
  - Do not revert unrelated dirty worktree changes.
- Important directories:
  - `.agent/` for working docs
  - `docs/` for user/developer-facing references
  - `js/` for application runtime
- Known constraints:
  - Multiple core files are already modified in the current worktree.
  - Git remote is currently unset.

## Working Rules

- Do not revert other people's changes.
- Keep edits focused on the task.
- Update the tracking docs as the task evolves.
- Use `implementation_plan.md` only when a fuller roadmap is needed.

## Useful References

- Docs:
  - `docs/ai-reference.md`
  - `.agent/implementation_plan.md`
- Decisions:
  - Finish visible gaps before adding broader new surface area.
- Commands:
  - `git status --short --branch`
  - `npm test`
